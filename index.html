				    Our Sunday school starts at 10:00am on Sunday morning and we offer classes for all ages. From Pre K. to the adults and even a Spanish class for the adults. The lessons are geared towards each age level. The classes are interactive, fun and exciting
					This also includes a children’s church service on Sunday morning. While the regular church service is going on your child is with their peers in a service geared for them. They sing songs that glorify the Lord and learn Bible stories. As well as crafts that emphasize God’s love.
				  </div>
				  <div class="content" id="bi">
				    On Tuesday evening we meet at 7:00pm and go through the Bible. This class is for those who desire a greater knowledge of God’s Word. Here notes are given and test taken. This is the same teaching you would get in a Bible college setting the only difference…….our class is free.
					The fall semester of 2012 we will be studying II Peter. This class does not run in the summer months so please call to make sure class in session
				  </div>
				  <div class="content" id="fmc">
				    Jesus said “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel” Every Saturday we go into our “Jerusalem” and take the gospel door to door. This is an exciting time of telling those in need of our great Saviour.
				  </div>
				  <div class="content" id="sm">
				    Our Spanish ministry is led by Jorge Moran. Brother Jorge came to know Christ several years ago and he has a great desire to see Spanish speaking people come to know the Lord. The cults and false teachers have targeted this group, and we by the grace of our Lord want to see them come to know the truth in Christ.
					All of our services are translated into Spanish. We have a Spanish service on friday evenings at 7:00pm and our Spanish church service on Sunday afternoon at 1:30pm. 
				  </div>
				  <div class="content" id="ya">
				    We offer activities for our young people, and these include various outings and trips. Are young people are taught the Word of God and are led by people who are putting into practice the things they teach and preach.
				  </div>
				  <div class="content" id="um">
				    An Usher is the ultimate servant in the church. His only responsibility is to meet the needs of his fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, as well as any visitors that may be present. As a result, ushering is one of the most important services a Christian can perform.
					Servitude is the heart of ushering. You are meeting both the physical and spiritual needs of the church, not to mention representing the church to anyone else who may come walking through the door. Through your actions and demeanor you are a representative not only of the church, but of the Lord Jesus Christ as well.
					Ushering is not just another job in the church, but rather one of the most important and rewarding services one can perform.
				  </div>
				  <div class="content" id="lf">
				    On the first Thursday of every month at 7pm the women of the church gather together. This meeting encompasses many things from Bible study, testimonies, prayer and being an encouragement to each other. Here they plan different activities and outings. You will be blessed and helped in this time.

						<p class="fs-24 tt-u c-lgr fw-b ta-c ff-pica">Scriptures</p>
						<p class="c-dgr fs-14  ff-alef">We believe in the verbal, plenary, divine inspiration of scripture.  Every word was breathed by God, and written by men moved by the Holy Ghost. The bible is our sole authority for faith and practice, and is completely inerrant.  We believe God originally inspired the Word, and perfectly preserved the Word through the 1611 King James Version of the Bible.  There is no need to change or better the Word of God.  It is perfect!(Isaiah 40:8; John 10:35; ll Timothy 3:16; ll Peter 1:19-21)</p>
					</div>

			    		<p class="c-dgr fs-14 ">There is one supreme God, omnipotent, all powerful, there is nothing He cannot do.  Our God is omniscient, all knowing.  Our God is also omnipresent meaning he is everywhere at all times.  He manifests Himself in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit;  He is one in nature, attributes, power and glory. ( Genesis 1:1; Mark 12:29; Matthew 28:19; ll Corinthians 13:14; John 1:1-4; John 5:17-27; Philippians 2:6-11).</p>

			    		<p class="c-dgr fs-14 ">Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary. He is therefore true God and true Man. Jesus Christ is impeccable in His nature and sinless in His life. He died on the cross and shed His precious blood as an atonement for our sins; was buried and rose again the third day. he ascended into Heaven and as our High Priest intercedes for us. He is coming again for His church (Matthew 1:18-25; John 1:1-4, 14; Philippians 2:6-11; Luke 1:26-35; l Timothy 3:16).</p>

						<p class="fs-24 tt-u c-lgr fw-b ta-c ff-pica">The Holy Spirit</p>
						<p class="c-dgr fs-14 ">The Holy Spirit is a Divine person; the third Person of the Trinity. he is the administrator of the things of God; convicting of sin, revealing Christ, teaching the truth, restraining evil, energizing believers in prayer, worship, and service and is ever present in the believer as our Comforter and Helper (Psalm 139:7-12; John 7:38-39, 15:26, 16:3, 14; Acts 1:8; Romans 8:9; l Corinthians 6:19; ll Thessalonians 2).</p>

			    		<p class="c-dgr fs-14 ">All who believe on Jesus Christ as Saviour are justified on the ground and merit of His shed blood on the cross, and are saved by grace through faith, wholly apart from human merit and works ( John 1:29; Acts 13:38-39; Ephesians 2:8-10; Titus 3:3-8). All who are born again by the Spirit of God through faith in Christ are eternally secure (John 5:24, 10:22-29; ll Timothy 1:12; Philippians 1:6; Romans 8:32-39).</p>

			    		<p class="c-dgr fs-14 ">The local church is a called out assembly of believers who assemble together in obedience to Christ's command for this age. The local New Testament church is the agency through which God works to carry out the Great Commission to the lost and dying world.  We believe that God has given the church two ordinances baptism by immersion and the Lord’s Supper. ( Matthew 16:18, 18:17, 28:19-20; l Corinthians 1:2; Mark 16:15-16).</p>
